### Abstract ###

This paper challenges the legitimacy of the idiom diagnostic, which has long seen employed in syntactic argumentation to distinguish movement from base generation. In response to Burukina [2020], who suggests reanalyzing several Russian control predicates in terms of ECM (exceptional case marking) based on the idiom test, we question the necessity of the alternative analysis. We provide data from Russian that the idiom test would make absurd predictions for, should Burukina's [2020] logic be followed through, and argue that idiomatic readings can be obtained in control environments, in line with the Constraint on Idiom Chunks [@Bruening:2015].

# Introduction

Idioms have long been used as a syntactic test meant to differentiate between movement and base generation in the realm of both A and A'-dependencies [@Postal:1976;  @Salzmann:2006; @Chomsky1995; @Chomsky:1965; @Vergnaud:1974; @Bhatt:2002; @Adger:2005; @Kwon:2006]. As the following examples from English featuring the idiom *the shit hit the fan* indicate, idioms are grammatical in cases of raising to subject, like example (@idiom-raising), but not control, like example (@idiom-control).

(@idiom-raising) They believe the shit *t* to have hit the fan yesterday. (raising to object)
(@idiom-control) \*They convinced the shit \[ PRO to have hit the fan \] yesterday. (object control)

The idiom test is supposed to work like this: if, as frequently assumed, all constitutive parts of an idiom must be adjacent at some point in the syntactic derivation, the availability of the idiomatic reading indicates the adjacency of what on the surface looks like the matrix object with the remainder of the idiom in the infinitival clause.

The idiom part *shit* in example (@idiom-raising) is base-generated in the embedded clause and is not occupying a thematic position in the matrix clause, so the sentence is acceptable. In example (@idiom-control), however, *shit* is base-generated as a matrix object, separately from the rest of the idiom in the embedded infinitival clause, which renders the sentence unacceptable.

Recent work on the syntax of Russian infinitival clauses has argued that a subset of structures traditionally analysed via object control are to be reanalysed in terms of either raising or exceptional case marking (ECM). The main evidence for this claim comes from the idiom test, namely, the availability of idiomatic readings when a subpart of an idiom inside an infinitival clause appears in the matrix clause as a main-clause object, as in (@burukina-koshka) from Burukina (2020).

(@burukina-koshka) Ja ne velel \[ cˇe ̈rnoj kosˇke probegat' mezˇdu nimi. \] 
I neg ordered black cat.dat run.inf between them
\`I did not order them to quarrel.' (lit.: \`I didn't order the black cat to run between them.')

This paper shows that, just like in English, idiom chunks in control environments in Russian can give rise to idiomatic interpretations. If Burukina's (2020) logic were followed through, one would be forced to postulate an additional ECM-like structural source for accusative object-control verbs as well as subject control with the putative controller inside the infinitival clause. This effectively amounts to restating the original question of why idiomatic readings are compatible with some verbs under some circumstances without actually answering it. It would also require an additional mechanism of accusative case assignment and nominative case assignment.

The paper is laid out as follows. (contents)

## Idioms in syntactic argumentation

The assumption under which idioms have been used in syntactic argumentation is that all constituent parts of an idiom must be adjacent at some part of the derivation. Thus, movement of an idiom part is possible, because it can proceed out of an idiom that was base-generated as a whole. Control or pronominal anaphora, on the other hand, require a part of an idiom to be base-generated outside of it, which prevents the idiomatic reading.

However, other researchers have taken issue with this assumption. [@Ruwet:1991] and [@Nunberg:1994] have shown that idioms actually can participate in control. Examples of pronominal anaphora and control with idioms in English abound on the Internet (--), as shown in [@Bruening:2015].

() I thought I would *miss the boat*, and miss **it** I did.
() The *plug* is waiting to be *pulled* once all the 5600 stock is gone... [@Bruening:2015]

The examples above demonstrate that idiom parts can be anaphorically referred to () and bind the embedded PRO () with the idiomatic interpretation kept intact, contrary to what would be expected under the logic that the idiom test is built on. We now turn from the broad range of cases that are problematic for the idiom diagnostic to one specific case -- Russian control predicates.

## Aims of the paper

We are going to demonstrate that the idiom test makes absurd predictions about Russian control predicates, if employed in the same way as in [@Burukina:2020]. As the Russian data indicates, idiom chunks are acceptable in object and subject control environments. Since idioms must have all their constituent parts together at some point, it must be possible for a control predicate's argument to be inside the embedded clause. Hence, one would be forced to postulate an additional ECM-like structure and a mechanism for assignment of the accusative and nominative case. The argumentative force of the idiom test is therefore lost, because any type of control-like structure can be shown to be ambiguous with respect to the nominative/accusative/dative/etc. argument's position. The question of why idioms are often unacceptable in control environments remains unanswered.

We suggest that the fault with the idiom diagnostic is that the reason for the said unacceptability is semantic rather than syntactic. 
Control is a syntactic phenomenon, however, the felicity of idioms with control/raising/ECM predicates does not serve as a good predictor of the structure type. The next section investigates the notion of control in Russian and provides the data that corroborate our claim.

# Russian idioms in control environments #

## Background ##

Control, raising and ECM are different syntactic configurations of subordinate clauses, typically non-finite, with an embedded argument that is mandatorily coreferent with a matrix argument (see [@Polinsky:2013] for detailed discussion of raising and control). Raising is a phenomenon of there being no theta-role to fill in the matrix clause, like in example (@r1). That is why the matrix subject can be an expletive, as shown in example (@r2). 

(@r1) John seems [ *t* to be upset. ]
(@r2) It seems (that) [ John is upset. ]

*John* in example (@r1) has a single theta-role -- it is the only argument of the embedded predicate *to be upset*. The matrix verb *seem* does not assign any theta-roles other than the proposition, so *John* can be located in the matrix clause, like in example (@r1), as well as in the embedded clause, like in example (@r2), since there is only one theta-role for it to occupy.

Control results from there being two thematic positions occupied by the same participant of the situation: in the matrix clause and in the embedded clause. Since it is not possible for one argument to fill two theta-roles, according to the theta-criterion (see @Chomsky:1981 for details), a silent pronoun appears in the embedded clause, whose reference is determined by an argument in the matrix clause, like in example (@c1).

(@c1) Kim_i wants [ PRO\textsubscript{i} to buy a house. ]

*Kim* in example (@c1) receives the \`wanter' role from the matrix verb *want* and the \`buyer' role from the embedded verb *buy*. One participant cannot have two theta-roles at once, so PRO appears in the embedded subject position.

Exceptional case marking (ECM) is different from both raising and control. The subject of the embedded clause receives its case from the matrix predicate (see @Chomsky:1981 for details). Despite being non-nominative, it occupies the embedded subject position rather than an argument position in the matrix clause, like in example (@ecm1) below.

(@ecm1) Kim wants [ \textbf{me} to buy a house. ]

*Me* is the subject of the embedded clause in example (@ecm1). However, it receives accusative case from the matrix predicate *wants*. Note that one and the same verb (*want*) can participate in  two different structures: control, like in example (@c1), and ECM, like in example (@ecm1).

@Burukina:2020, as mentioned before, proposes an alternative analysis for Russian mandative verbs with dative arguments. Such predicates as *velet'* \`order', *razrešit'* \`allow', *pomogat'* \`help', *mešat'* \`hinder', which appear to assign a thematic role in the matrix clause, and hence to exhibit control, have been claimed by @Burukina:2020 to actually produce an ambiguity. The two possible structures are shown in example (@schema). In particular, the dative argument can either denote the Holder of the obligation and be coreferent with the embedded PRO (i.e. traditional object control) or be located in the embedded clause itself, similarly to the ECM structures of English and other languages. The first reading of example (@mand) results when *Voldemort* is the Holder (see the schema in example @str1), and the second is derived when *Voldemort* is the embedded subject (see the schema in example @str2).

(@str1) {[} \emph{pomoč/pomešat'} DP.DAT\textsubscript{i} {[} PRO\textsubscript{i} \emph{infinitive} {] ]}
(@str2) {[} \emph{pomoč/pomešat'} [ DP.DAT \emph{infinitive} {] ]} @Burukina:2021, p. 5

(@mand) Direktor prikazal Voldemortu ubit' mal'čika.
director.{\Nom} ordered Voldemort.{\Dat} kill.{\Inf} boy.{\Acc}
\`The director ordered Voldemort that he should kill the boy'.
\`The director ordered that Voldemort should kill the boy'. @Burukina:2020, p. 9

One argument @Burukina:2020 provides in support of her analysis is based on the interpretation of idiom chunks. Her reasoning goes as follows: sentences with a mandative verb and an idiom, such as example (@mandid), can keep the idiomatic reading. Thus, the constituent parts of the idiom must have been base-generated together, so there must be some option other than control, she presupposes that it is ECM.

(@mandid) Ja ne velel čёrnoj koške probegat' meždu nimi.
I {\Neg} ordered black cat.{\Dat} run.{\Inf} between them 
Literally: \`I did not order the black cat to run between them.'
Idiomatic reading available: \`I did not order them to quarrel.' @Burukina:2020, p. 8

@Burukina:2020 contrasts Russian mandative predicates with \`proper' object control predicates such as *zastavit'* \`force' that do not create such an ambiguity and also disallow idiomatic readings.

## Defining control ##

The definition of control via the notion of theta-roles, which we have given in the previous section, makes the nature of control dependent on one's understanding of theta-roles. They can be conceptualized as handled by the semantic module, which would imply that Theta Criterion is replaced by a compositionality requirement (in the sense of formal semantics) and control becomes a semantically driven phenomenon [@Bruening:2013; @HeimKratzer:1998??? see Collins' ms. for this reference]. Theta-roles can also be argued to belong in the syntax: assymetries between arguments receiving different roles have been analysed using argument introducing heads [@Kratzer1996; @Pylkkanen:2008]. @Collins:2021 has suggested a Merge-based theory of theta-roles, which places them in the syntactic module as well. 

We are going to adopt the middle ground: arguments are projected in the syntax, whereas the wide variety of theta-roles, which can be highly specific, is handled by semantics.

In order to show that proper control predicates allow for idiomatic readings when combined with idioms, we need a syntactic diagnostic that would distinguish control predicates from all the other types (resructuring, raising, ECM). Recall that the only property that sets control apart is that the predicate of the clause embedded under them has to have at least one argument (PRO), or else there would be nothing to control. Thus, the presence of an embedded PRO could be witnessed by the unacceptability of the matrix predicate with argumentless \`weather predicates' such as *smerkat'sja* \`get dark' etc. ()

() * resˇilo/xotelo/gotovo/zastavilo smerkat'sja 
decided/wanted/ready/forced get.dark.inf
(\`It decided/wanted/is ready/forced to get dark.')

The verb *smerkat'sja* \`get dark' has zero arguments, so it is not possible to build a control structure with it: the control predicates require an argument to control from the matrix clause.

Another phenomenon that can be utilized to distinguish control from movement in Russian is negative concord (@Letuchiy:2020). The negative concord item (NCI) *nikto* \`nobody' can be the subject of a raising predicate but not control predicate, with the negation being in the embedded clause.

() Nikomu možno [ *t* ne prixodit'].
nobody.DAT may not come
\`It is OK if nobody comes' may > NEG
() \*Nikto xočet [PRO ne prixodit'].
nodoby.NOM wants not come
Extected: \`Nobody wants to come'

*Nikto* \`nobody' is moved from the embedded clause, so at least part of the movement chain is C-commanded by negation, so the negative concord reading is accessible. However, with the control structure in () it is not possible to license negative concord, since the NCI is beyond the scope of negation. The inability of NCIs as control predicate's arguments to be licensed by the embedded negation is reproduced for other control predicates that have been discussed so far (--) and for mandative verbs with dative arguments as well ().

The substitution of the embedded clause with the demonstrative pronoun *eto* \`this' is used by @Letuchiy2020 as a movement diagnostic. Raising predicates allow for this substitution (), while control predicates do not ().

**Should we add another control versus movement test before it becomes boring?**

In light of the behaviour of control predicates described above, we are going to treat control as a syntactic phenomenon, whose defining feature is that they necessarily introduce a nominal argument. We have also shown *xotet'* \`want', *zastavit'* \`force', *resˇit'* and *gotov* \`ready' to be genuine control predicates in this sense.

## Semantic restrictions on arguments of control predicates ##

Our proposal states that the constrains that rule out idiomatic readings in control environments are semantic, so the semantic restrictions on arguments of control predicates beg to be investigated.

Some of the predicates discussed in the previous section impose no animacy/sentience requirements on their arguments, despite being genuine control predicates. As evidenced by the examples below, their arguments can be inanimate () or non-sentient (). 

()
()

On the other hand, there are control verbs that do require their arguments to possess some degree of sentience. For instance, *ubedit'* \`to convince' is marginally acceptable with non-sentient participants (). This sentence can be perceived as a joke or a metaphor, meaning that the bottle took some time or effort to open.

()

An anonymous reviewer suggests that the limits to which the standards of acceptability can be stretched to include such interpretations as metaphors and irony are hard to define. This only goes to show that control predicates are not to be probed by tests that rely on interpretations, since it is possible to imbue a sentence with a non-standard interpretation if necessary, and this is indeed possible with idiomatic readings.

## Idioms in control environments ##

The four predicates that we have shown to exhibit control and impose no animacy or sentience requirements on their arguments are compatible with idioms, with the idiomatic reading preserved (--).

() Delo ne xotelo [ PRO dvigat'sja s me ̈rtvo ̆ı tocˇki ] 
business not wanted move from dead point
\`Things wouldn't get moving.' (lit.: \`didn't want to move from the dead point')

() Vcˇera u menja na dusˇe vnezapno kosˇki resˇili [ PRO zaskresti ] 
yesterday at me on soul suddenly cats decided scratch.inf
\`Yesterday, I suddenly started feeling really sad.'

() Naprjazˇennoe molcˇanie zastavljalo atmosferu [ PRO sgusˇcˇat'sja vse ̈ sil'nee ].
tense silence was making atmosphere solidify all stronger 
\`The heavy silence was making people in the room feel more and more uneasy'.

()

The acceptability of idioms with these control predicates does not distinguish them from the verbs *pomogat'* \`help' and *mesˇat'* \`hinder', which Burukina (2021) argues to occasionally require an ECM structure ().

() Nikakie utesˇenija ne mesˇali slezam [ PRO lit'sja v tri rucˇ'ja ] 
no comforting neg hinder tears.dat pour in three streams
\`No comforting could prevent (somebody) from crying...'

() pomogat'

There are, nevertheless, control verbs that do not preserve idiomatic readings ().

() * Menedzˇer ubedil delo [ PRO sdvinut'sja s me ̈rtvo ̆ı tocˇki ] 
manager convinced business move from dead point
Expected: (\`The manager convinced things to get moving.')

Thus, the idiom diagnostic does not reliably identify the type of structure that a certain verb requires. We suggest that there is, however, another rule at play when determining, whether the idiomatic reading is available.

# Analysis: the constraint on idiom chunks #

To capture the data above showing full compatibility of some control verbs with idiom chunks we adopt Bruening's (2015) Constraint on Idiom Chunks, according to which an idiom chunk appearing in position 1 and anaphorically related to position 2 must not receive an interpretation either in position 1 or position 2 that is inconsistent with its interpretation in the idiom. 

>[T]he only requirement on idioms is that a chunk of an idiom not receive an interpretation that is inconsistent with its idiomatic interpretation. Once this constraint is satisfied, idiom chunks can participate in pronominal anaphora and control in addition to movement.* [@Bruening:2015]

The subjects of the idiomatic expressions in (--) are all nonsentient NPs *delo* \`business', *atmosfera* \`atmosphere' and *sle ̈zy ̄* \`tears'. They are nonsentient both in position 1 in the matrix clause, because the control predicates *resˇit'* \`decide', *zastavit'* \`force', *gotov* \`ready', and *xotet'* \`want' in a subset of contexts do not impose a sentience requirement on their nominal argument, and in the corresponding idioms. Position 2 is occupied by PRO in the infinitival clause. The constraint is not violated, and the idiomatic interpretations obtain. The same constraint rules out idiomatic interpretations with other control verbs such as *ubedit'* \`convince' (), which do impose a particular interpretation on their nominal argument: *ubedit'* \`convince' requires an NP (position 1) capable of being persuaded by arguments. Because that interpretation is inconsistent with the interpretation of the inanimate nonsentient delo \`business' in the idiom, the idiomatic reading is unavailable in ().

() \*Menedzˇer ubedil delo [ PRO sdvinut'sja s me ̈rtvo ̆ı tocˇki ] 
manager convinced business move from dead point
Expected: (\`The manager convinced things to get moving.')

As regards the difference between *xotet'* \`want', *zastavit'* \`force', *resˇit'* and *gotov* \`ready' on the one hand and *ubedit'* \`convince' and its ilk on the other, we propose that, even though they are syntactically identical control predicates, the observed differences come from their lexical semantics/encyclopaedic knowledge. What sets control predicates apart from raising and ECM ones, then, is the requirement that they syntactically introduce a nominal argument in the sense of @Kratzer:1996 and @Pylkka ̈nen:2008, while the particular and sometimes highly specific theta-roles are handled by the meaning component, contra @Collins:2021.

The reasoning that leads @Burukina:2020 to postulating control/ECM ambiguity can be carried to the absurd. Suppose the idiom test is compelling evidence for the matrix predicate's argument residing in the embedded clause. As we have seen in previous sections, such an argument can be made for predicates with nominative and accusative arguments as well as dative. This would necessitate a structure that would exceptionally assign nominative or accusative case. Also, since the idiom test can potentially deem every control predicate to be ambiguous between control and ECM, there remains an open question of what this diagnostic actually shows.

We therefore reject the premise that the availability of idiomatic interpretations in control contexts necessitates the postulation of an additional structural source such as placing the controller NP in the embedded subject position. Control can handle the idiom facts and the animacy/sentience facts from @Burukina:2020 all by itself.

# Conclusion #

We have demonstrated that the idiom diagnostic is not reliable in identifying structural differences, because there are other factors at play, namely, the consistency of the combined interpretation of separated idiom chunks with the idiomatic interpretation. Control predicates differ as to how rigorously they restrict their arguments in terms of animacy, sentience, etc. Therefore, some of them are compatible with idioms and some are not, while their syntactic properties such as the mandatorily introduced argument are constant. We therefore doubt whether reanalysing of control structures based on the idiom diagnostic is reasonable.
