# Background: Idioms in syntactic argumentation # 

Idioms have long been used as a syntactic test meant to diferentiate between move- ment and base generation in the realm of both A and Aâ€™-dependencies [@Postal:1976;  @Salzmann:2006; @Chomsky1995; @Chomsky:1965; @Vergnaud:1974; @Bhatt:2002; @Adger:2005; @Kwon:2006]. As the following examples from English featuring the idiom *the shit hit the fan* indicate, idioms are grammatical in cases of raising to subject, like example (@idiom-raising), but not control, like example (@idiom-control).

(@idiom-raising) They believe the shit *t* to have hit the fan yesterday. (raising to object)
(@idiom-control) \*They convinced the shit [ PRO to have hit the fan ] yesterday. (object control)
